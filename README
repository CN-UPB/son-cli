How to develp this project

Prerequisites:

python 3 (3.4 used for most of the development)
virtualenv is recommended to avoid polluting your system instalation

Building a virtualenv:
1. Install virtualenvwrapper using your distribution repositories or the pip package
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

2. Create a virtualenv for this project 
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python34 sonata

3. activate the virtualenv before starting your work
$ workon sonata
your prompt will change to show the current virtualenv name

3. bootstrab buildout
$ python bootstrap.py

4. run buildout
$ bin/buildout
this creates the remaining binaries on your bin directory.

TODO: figure out how to install this system wide (or virtualenv wide) 
but that is low on the priority list

If you are using pycharm, the IDE has support both for buildout and for virtualenvs, 
please read their documentation before proceeding
